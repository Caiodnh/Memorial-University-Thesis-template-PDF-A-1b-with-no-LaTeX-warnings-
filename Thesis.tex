\documentclass[12pt]{pdfathesis}

%%%% If you want to format you entire thesis you can use another document class.
%%%% In such a case you need to use the `\usepackage{pdfathesis}' command instead, ie, replace the command before and uncomment the following:

%\usepackage{pdfathesis}

% ----------------- %
% * YOUR PREAMBLE * %
% ----------------- %

%%%% Include all packages that you need.

%%%% Many of the basic math packages/macros are in the next file
%% You can replace it by your own file and or add your preferred packages/macros here

\usepackage{my-stuff/basic-preamble}

%%%% The next package is useful when editing your thesis, it prints the labels of definitions/theorems on the right margin of the pdf.
%% You should comment it out for the final version
\usepackage{showlabels}

% ------------------- %
% * FRONT PAGE DATA * %
% ------------------- %

%%%% To not clutter this file too much, I put this in other file
%%%% There you put things like the Title and Student's and Supervisor's name, that go in the front page.

\input{pdfathesis-stuff/front_page}

% ----------------------------------- %
% * ADDITIONAL PREAMBLE DEFINITIONS * %
% ----------------------------------- %

%%%% These were in JC's original file, and I decided to keep because I don't know how important they are:

\setlength{\parskip}{6pt}

%% If you do not know what a colorspace profile is, leave next macro alone
%\ColorspaceProfile{file}{profile description}{number of components}

%% the next line include the MinonPro fonts for pdfLaTeX; 
%% you may not have them or not need them.
% \ifpdf\usepackage{MinionPro}\pdfmapfile{+MinionPro.map}\fi 
%% Do not include unnecessary packages (inclusion of packages 
%% that you no use just makes documents hard to debug)
